# 112-Dash-Term-Project
Shubham Bhasin - "112 Dash" term project

These files are the code files for my Term Project for Pre-College 15-112 Course.

This code will contain multiple files, to show different sections of code, for proper organisation of code, and also to help me to find bugs in my code, and which section does which part of the project. I love organising >>(  o  u  o  )<<.

If there are any suggestions or things which you want me to change or anything which is required to be adjusted or altered, please inform me about it in the other file called "Changes". Thank you! <3
